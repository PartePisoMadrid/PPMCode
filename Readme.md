# PPM Software
Software designed and used by Parte Piso de Madrid.

Print the Parte by downloading a Google Sheet from a Google Drive account, converting it to a csv, and adding its values to an Excel file for printing. When necessary, it create the Parte for the next week by copying a Parte template from the Google Drive account (changing the cells containing dates) and share with the Piso Conctacts using the Google People API.

## Send Mail (future project)
This aims to send an email to contacts who have not filled out the Parte reviewing the data in the Parte gsheet for the corresponding week.

## Face Recognition (future project)
This aims to create a program that connects to a camera system and recognize a given set of faces.
